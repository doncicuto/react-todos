## Simple Todo

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Yet another todo list application that I've created as a weekend project using:

- React.js
- Semantic UI for React
- React-intl

Currently the application does the following:

- You can create new tasks and set them as completed or back again to a pending state.
- You can filter the tasks, search the tasks with a term or sort the tasks by the title or the creation date.
- It supports English and Spanish languages.
